# This is Go - The Auto Mouse
## What can it do?
Creates random or Specified mouse movements with a more human like curve using the bezier library. So far it can do 3 things:

    1. Make a specified number of random movements with human-like curvature 
    2. Infinitley move around the screen to random positions with human-like curvature
    3. Locate Image/s on Screen and and move mouse to them with human-like curvature 
If  you are using the image feature you can specify a local image on your machine or you can specify a weblink such as: https://i.imgur.com/g756vf6hd.png

The script will down load the image or images move around and click around, then it will delete them from your system.
